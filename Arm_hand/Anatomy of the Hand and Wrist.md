Hands and wrists are a complicated network of bones, muscles, nerves, connective tissue and blood vessels

Hand begins where your wrist ends. It includes your palm, fingers and thumb.

Your hand and wrist get blood from two arteries. 
The [[radial artery]] runs along your radius (closer to your thumb). 
The [[ulnar artery]] runs along your ulna (closer to your pinkie finger). 
These arteries communicate with each other in “[[arches]]” that form in your hand. There’s a superficial and deep arch in your hand. Vessels branch off the arches and supply blood to your fingers.
